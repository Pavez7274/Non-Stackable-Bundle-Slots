# Non-Stackable Bundle Slots

A simple server-side Fabric mod that allows bundles to store non-stackable items  
(such as tools, enchanted books, etc.) at a reduced slot cost.  
Each non-stackable item now occupies **1/5 of a bundle's capacity** instead of the full stack size,  
allowing up to 5 non-stackable items per bundle.

This mod does **not** allow shulker boxes to be stored in bundles.  
Compatible with vanilla clients.
